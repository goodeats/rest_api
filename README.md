# Node JS Server

Making a simple server to reference for Node projects.

I have much more experience in Ruby on Rails so wanted to get a Node server demo on the board since that is also very popular in web development.

## Run

`npm start` or `yarn start` or `node index.js`

## About
### Express JS

Express JS simplifies the routing by reducing the need to write a lot of if statements. They have a great reference [here](https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html)

### Nodemon

Run the server with [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) so you don't have to resetart the server manually

### Environment Variables

Using environment variables will help hide keys or offer flexibility in setting values for different environments (development, staging, production).

Here is a great blog from the fine folks at Twilio about different ways to set this up: [Working With Environment Variables in Node.js](https://www.twilio.com/blog/working-with-environment-variables-in-node-js-html).
